CodSoft Machine Learning Internship Projects
Internship Duration: September 25, 2025 â€“ October 25, 2025
Organization: CodSoft (Virtual Internship)
Domain: Machine Learning

Overview
This repository contains the projects completed during my Machine Learning Virtual Internship at CodSoft.
The internship provided practical experience in applying data preprocessing, feature engineering, and predictive modeling techniques to solve real-world problems.

Projects Included
1. Credit Card Fraud Detection
Objective: Develop a machine learning model to detect fraudulent credit card transactions.
Key Concepts: Imbalanced data handling, anomaly detection, model evaluation.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, Scikit-learn, Matplotlib, Seaborn.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, Decision Tree.
Outcome: Achieved high precision and recall for the fraud class through effective sampling and model tuning.

2. Customer Churn Prediction
Objective: Predict whether a customer is likely to stop using a service based on behavioral and demographic data.
Key Concepts: Data preprocessing, feature selection, predictive analytics.
Tech Stack: Python, Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn.
Models Used: Logistic Regression, Random Forest, XGBoost.
Outcome: Identified key churn factors and improved prediction accuracy using tuned hyperparameters.

3. Spam SMS Detection
Objective: Classify SMS messages as Spam or Ham (Not Spam) using text classification techniques.
Key Concepts: Natural Language Processing (NLP), TF-IDF Vectorization, Text Preprocessing.
Tech Stack: Python, NLTK, Scikit-learn, Pandas.
